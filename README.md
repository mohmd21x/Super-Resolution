# Super-Resolution
this is an End-to-end model with super resulotion and YOLO object detection.
In this case we'll get an image with low resulotion and convert it to a high-resolution image and finally we'll give it to a YOLO object detection model and all of this process will work simultaneous and model learn two losses at same time!
